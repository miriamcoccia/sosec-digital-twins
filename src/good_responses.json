As a 10-Right-leaning individual, I believe that we need to secure our borders to prevent illegal immigration and protect our national security. However, I also believe that we must do so in a way that is compassionate and respects human rights. We need to focus on solutions that address the root causes of illegal immigration, such as poverty and lack of opportunity, while also ensuring that our borders are secure. I'm open to hearing thoughtful arguments on both sides of the issue, and I believe that we can find a solution that is both effective and humane.\"",
